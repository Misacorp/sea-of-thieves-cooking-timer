# Sea of Thieves Cooking Timer

Give the aspiring pirate chef within you the proper tools to succeed. This web application lets you create timers for the various cookable foods in Sea of Thieves. Playing with a crew? Create an online room and invite your shipmates on board. They'll see the same timers as you will, allowing someone else to take your precious Ruby Splashtail off the pan while you're already fishing for the next catch.

This application is still heavily in development. Visit the latest version here: [misacorp.github.io/sea-of-thieves-cooking-timer](https://misacorp.github.io/sea-of-thieves-cooking-timer/)

## TODO

This is where I dump ideas in order to clear my head. Check the [Issues page](https://github.com/Misacorp/sea-of-thieves-cooking-timer/issues) for a broader view of what remains to be done.

- Create a room cleanup loop on the server. Check for rooms that have been inactive for __ minutes and destroy them.
